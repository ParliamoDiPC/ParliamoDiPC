### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

I'm **Parliamo**/ParliamoDiPC, and I'm a """developer""" that likes to work on whatever is on my mind at a given time. I mostly work on websites.

ðŸ’» Projects: [**Coderkick Forums**](https://coderkick.com), a user-centered website based on sharing one's own projects hoping for someone to join them in a common goal.

    <li><b>CSS</b>: <b>intermediate knowledge</b>, can style simple pages with good responsiveness (like this one!) using CSS
                    Grid but also more complex ones if I'm given enough time<br>

    <li><b>JavaScript</b>: <b>basic knowledge</b></li>
    <li><b>PHP</b>: <b>intermediate knowledge</b>, can code pretty complex pages but
